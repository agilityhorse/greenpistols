          Hi, I'm Maciek, graphic designer in clothing company.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve noticed that many companies use animal themed designs on socks
          and other clothing without acknowledging the actual animals, or
          treating them with the respect they deserve respect that would be
          given to a human model. They profit from it, treating animals like
          products. I feel that this isn’t right, and I’m against it.
          <br />
          <br />I founded <strong>Green Pistols</strong> as an opportunity to
          support organizations that, like me, care about animals and can help
          fund my project.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m vegan, I live with two cats, and I’m just a chill guy trying to do
          something good.
